# About
The RTTSR (Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition) application is designed to assist road users in identifying and predicting traffic signs on the road. Using image recognition technology and machine learning, the app allows users to capture images of traffic signs, then automatically predicts the type of sign and provides detailed information about them. The app also creates an opportunity to share information about traffic signs with the community, contributing to improving road safety.
